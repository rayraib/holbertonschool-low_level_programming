# holbertonschool-low_level_programming 
#### This repository contains Holberton School's project to learn and practice low-level programming with C language.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Project | Description  |
| ---- | -----------  |
| **0x00-hello_word** | Contains task to learn about what C programmaing language is along with its history, the C compilation process and Betty, the official Holberton C coding style.|
|**0x01-variables_if_else_while**| Contains additional tasks about C language focusing on: keywords and identifiers, integers, Arithmetic operators in C, If statements in C, if..else statements, Relational operators, logical operators, and while loop in C.|
|**0x02-funtions_nested_loops**|Contains tasks to learn more about nested while loops, funtions, header files and function prototypes and their usage.|
|**0x03-more_funtions_nested_loops**| In continuation of projecct 0x02, tasks to further practice nested while loops, creating functions, header files, function prototypes and their usage.|
|**0x04-pointers_arrays_strings**| Contains tasks to learn about Arrays and pointers in C.|
|**0x05-pointers_arrays_strings**| In continuation of 0x05, contains additional tasks to continue practising using pointers and arrays.|
|**0x06-pointers_arrays_strings**| Contains tasks to continue practicing accessing, manipulating and using arrays and functions|
