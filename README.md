## 0x02-funtions_nested_loops
Project is to learn more about nested while loops in C, funtions, header files and function prototypes and their usage.
## 0x03-more_funtions_nested_loops
Project, in continuation of 0x02, is to learn further more about nested while loops in C, funtions, header files and function prototypes and their usage.
